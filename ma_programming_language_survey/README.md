This project allows you to use all the HTML forms knowledge you’ve learned so far. Using what you know about input elements create a detailed form gathering information about a user.

In this project, you are creating a basic survey form for the students and faculty of Melsoft Academy to find out what their favourite programming language is with any additional comments they would like to submit.

At a minimum, your form must have the elements and features listed below.

Form element with a post method
Fieldset element
Legend element titled “Add user”
Single-lined text input field for the first name
Single-lined text input field for the last name
Single-lined text input field for the email address
Select an element labelled “Status” with three options:
Student
Instructor
Guest
A <p> tag with the sentence “Choose your favourite programming language:”
A radio button with the label “HTML”
A radio button with the label “CSS”
A radio button with the label “JavaScript”
A text area labelled “Comments”
Input element for the date labelled current date
A checkbox input element labelled “Sign up for the newsletter”
A checkbox input element labelled “Agree to terms and conditions”
A submit button labelled “Submit”

A radio button with the label “JavaScript”
Phase 5: Additional Information
Create elements that allow the user to input additional information and the current date.

After you are done, save all your files. In the next section after HTML, you will learn how to upload all your code to Git, a place where mentors and recruiters can see all your code as well as the websites you have made.
